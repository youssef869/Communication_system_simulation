# Introduction
In this project, we simulated a communication system based on amplitude modulation and
frequency-division multiplexing. We explored recording and filtering audio, as well as
displaying its spectrum in MATLAB.
# Implementation
1) We recorded two segments of our voice of about 10 seconds each selecting appropriate
values for sampling frequency and bit depth (‘input1.wav’ and ‘input2.wav’).
2) Then using a LPF we limited the maximum frequency of both signals to a suitable value
such that the quality of audio is not significantly affected.
3) We plotted the magnitude spectrum of both signals before and after filtering against the frequency in
Hz using FFT.
4) We performed amplitude modulation on both signals in a frequency-division multiplexing system,
using suitable carrier frequencies.
5) We designed a receiver to obtain each of the two signals from the transmitted signal saving the audio
files as ‘output1.wav’ and ‘output2.wav’ and then we plotted the magnitude spectrum of each.
